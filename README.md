# Streamlit app for Energy Consumption Prediction

#### Data Science Project with user interactive UI for prediction :
Smart building energy management systems need accurate energy consumption predictions to
optimize energy usage, reduce costs, and support sustainability goals. 

The Streamlit app is built for Energy Consumption Prediction in Smart Buildings to conqure this above stated use case.

#### Problem Statement: 
Smart buildings often have IoT devices that collect data such as temperature, humidity, and
occupancy. Using this data, the application developed aim to predict the energy consumption for better resource
allocation.


#### TechStack Used

For Data Sciense and backend:

`Python` `pandas` `seaborn` `matplotlib` `scikit-learn` 

For Frontend UI:

`streamlit` `joblib`
